# surveyserver
basic python survey server

I tried several survey engines and all seemed far too complicated to serve such a simple need.
My goal is to build a complete survey engine that is simple enough to adapt in code, not using some
point and click "builder" to generate some generic survey. 

The sample data will give you an idea how it is structured so you can adapt it to your own survey. 

Results processing will depend upon how your survey functions. In this case, it will be a sum function
of results in each category of statements. Your needs will likely be entirely different, or may be similar.
Results processing for this sample code will follow.
